This is a read me file. I think I am getting used to it. Learning in Alx is very interesting since you develope youself.
You don't have to take hours of tutorial rather you read, you watch or whatever you do, You are responsible for your
own learning which I love the most. We are given projects without any tutor but references and materials where we 
can read and understand some powerful languages.
